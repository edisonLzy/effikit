# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Mock Rule Application Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure that mock rules are applied to matching requests and that they override the actual responses.
# Details:
Write logic to check each request against stored mock rules. Apply the first matching rule's response. Ensure that mock responses are only applied locally and not to the actual server.

# Test Strategy:
Test mock rule application with various request scenarios. Verify that mock responses are applied correctly and that actual responses are used when no rules match.
