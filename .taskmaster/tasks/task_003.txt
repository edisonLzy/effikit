# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Network Request Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the network request monitoring feature to capture and display all network requests in the browser.
# Details:
Use Chrome's devtools protocol to intercept and log network requests. Display requests in a list with method, URL, status, and time. Ensure compatibility with XHR and fetch requests.

# Test Strategy:
Test request capture with different types of requests (XHR, fetch). Verify that the list updates in real-time and displays correct request details.
