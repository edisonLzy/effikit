# Task ID: 2
# Title: Develop Tool Management UI
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a search bar for real-time tool search and a grid-based tool list styled like Mac Launchpad, with seamless navigation to tool details.
# Details:
Design a search bar at the middle-bottom of the page for real-time tool name search. Display a grid-based tool list above the search bar, featuring icon-based tool representations. Implement smooth navigation to a tool's dedicated page when a tool is selected.

# Test Strategy:
Verify real-time search functionality with keyword inputs. Confirm grid layout renders correctly on different screen sizes. Test seamless navigation to tool detail pages upon selection.
